# logicsim

A simple discrete-event digital logic simulator, implemented in Java. Intended partly as an example of discrete-event simulation, and partly as a classroom example of applying various classic "Gang of Four" design patterns (command, decorator, observer, etc.)

The main `LogicSim` class includes a couple of examples that show how the simulator can be used to model and simulate simple logic circuits.
